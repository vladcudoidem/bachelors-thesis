# Bachelor's Thesis: Elevated Testing Depth and Quality for Design Implementations through Screenshot Testing

This repository contains the PDF of my bachelor's thesis and the slides for my thesis defense.

## Abstract

The human factor in manual design verification makes the process time-consuming and error-prone.
This thesis develops a strategy for automating design verification in Android applications with the help of screenshot
testing. Such an objective requires choosing the right tool, managing the screenshot data and integrating
screenshot testing into the CI/CD process. Maximizing the value that screenshot testing adds to the software
project requires formulating a test case implementation strategy that defines what parts of the application
UI should be verified and when. This research also touches on topics such as image comparison algorithms
and Git's problematic handling of binary files. The objective of the strategy developed in this thesis
is the reduction of manual testing efforts in regard to design verification and the quick and
reliable detection of UI regressions in Android applications.
